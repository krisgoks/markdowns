# Search medical codes for IMRD, Gold, Aurum, Cegedim and (soon) HES databases

Ever been in a situation where you had to create medical/drug codes for more than one EMR system? And worse, you had to do it individually for each database? Well, your worries are now over! With the help of this tool you can search for various medical codes and drug codes across different medical databases such as IMRD, CPRD Gold, CPRD Aurum, HES simultaneously.



# How to use?

- Click on ‘Medical codes’ or ‘Drug codes’ in the left sidebar.
- The search can be conducted using various fields as shown in the top input boxes.
- Type the choice of query in the input boxes, for example: Searching for the Read code C10F.00 yields all the medical codes represented by that Read Code, across all databases. 


# Wildcard

Our tool supports the asterisk (\*) wildcard, it can be used to search for strings that are a subset of a bigger text. For example:
 - Searching medical codes descriptions with `*Type 1 diabetes` yields all the codes where the descriptions **ends with** the term 'Type 1 diabetes'
 - Similarly searching medical codes descriptions with `Type 1 diabetes*` yields all the codes where the descriptions **starts with** the term 'Type 1 diabetes'
 - Alternatively, you can just type `Type 1 diabetes` or you can use the asterisk operator as follows `*Type 1 diabetes*` to search for all medical codes who's description **contains** the term 'Type 1 diabetes'
